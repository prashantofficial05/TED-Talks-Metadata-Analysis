### TED Talks Metadata Analysis

**Introduction:**  

  This project involves an in-depth analysis of TED Talks using metadata. The aim is to derive insights into the patterns 
  and trends of TED Talks and build a recommendation system based on the talk titles using NLP techniques. The analysis 
  focuses on understanding talk popularity, duration trends, event-based analysis, and NLP-based topic modeling using 
  talk titles.

**Goal:**
     To analyze TED Talks data to identify trends in talk popularity, understand the event-based distribution, and 
     implement an NLP-based recommendation system to recommend talks based on similar titles.
**Description:**
  The project utilizes TED Talks metadata to:

  - **Analyze Talk Trends:** Understand the distribution of talks over time and across events.
  - **Identify Popular Talks:** Determine which talks received the most views and likes.
  - **Duration Analysis:** Evaluate the relationship between talk duration and popularity.
  - **NLP Analysis of Titles:** Preprocess and tokenize titles, visualize common words, and build a recommendation 
      system based on title similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
 
     
**Skills:**
  - **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas), SQL
  - **Data Visualization:** Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - **NLP:** Tokenization, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity
    
  - **Tools:**
      **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

**Metrics:**
  - **Talk Trends:** Yearly and event-based trends in the number of talks.
  - **Popular Talks:** Views and likes metrics to identify top-performing talks.
  - **Duration Analysis:** Relationship between duration and views/likes.
  - **Recommender System Performance:** Recommendations based on title similarity.
  -  
**Summary:**

   The analysis provided insights into TED Talk trends, top-performing talks, and duration-based popularity. NLP 
   techniques were used to preprocess and analyze talk titles, leading to the creation of a recommender system that 
   suggests similar talks based on title content. Recommendations were made to identify which events consistently 
   produce popular talks.
   

**Next Steps:**
  - **Implement Recommendations:** Use insights to refine event planning and focus on content that resonates most with 
       viewers.
  - **Extended Analysis:** Incorporate text data (e.g., transcripts) for a more detailed analysis of talk content.
  - **Data Enrichment:** Include additional features like speaker profiles and audience engagement metrics for deeper 
       insights.
